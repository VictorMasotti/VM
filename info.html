<div class="aa"><a class="aaa" href="fotovm.jpg" target="_blank">BIO<br>Victor Masotti, (born September 20, 2006, Rimini, Italy), is a self-taught Italian artist and sculptor based in London since 2015. Fascinated by geometry, shapes and colours, Victor Masotti uses his unique self-taught approach to art to create works that highlight precision, environment, perception, and general mood. By focusing primarily on simple shapes, being influenced by the De Stijl and Concretism art movements, Masotti manages to put together works that stay intact, that form a juxtaposition of colours and lines that works and that enables to defy any basilar logic observable by the viewer. With the specific goal of colouring the world and making it better through art, he experiments and manoeuvres between vastly different yet remarkably similar mediums and scales. Immense sculptures that reshape the space around you; drawings full of diverse combinations and colours; canvasses that invite the viewer to follow the straight lines and feel immersed by bold colour. Masotti's geometry allows for colours to create their own world and for each artwork to be seen in a slightly different way each time. His recent sculptures, for example, allow for the work to create different visual patterns and diverse display options, since there is no logic behind them and no rules applied, yet the result becomes obvious and suddenly makes you feel like it is a whole another piece.</a></div>
